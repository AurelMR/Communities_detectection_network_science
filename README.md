# Communities_detectection_network_science
Final project of the Machine Learning in Network Science class at CentraleSupelec

## Introduction

The goal of the project was to study and compare the different graph clustering methods.

## Content
We studied 5 different clustering algorithms:
* Girvan Newman
* Spectral Clustering
* Modularity Maximization
* Louvain / Surprise / Leiden Community Detection
* Walktrap Community Detection


## Evaluation of the methods
Assessing the performance of unsupervised problems can be a difficult task. We needed to identify meaningful metrics to be able to compare the algorithms.  
The metrics we used are all intuitive and based on common sense when thinking about how a community should behave (internaly and externaly).
