# Communities_detectection_network_science
Final project of the Machine Learning in Network Science class at CentraleSupelec.  
Th notebook is not ready to use, you first need to install a few libraries and to download the data.


## Introduction

The goal of the project was to study and compare the different graph clustering methods.

## Data

The data we used come from Stanford SNAP database where we downloaded the friend circle network as well as the youtube graph.

## Content
We studied 5 different clustering algorithms:
* Girvan Newman
* Spectral Clustering
* Modularity Maximization
* Louvain / Surprise / Leiden Community Detection
* Walktrap Community Detection


## Evaluation of the methods
Assessing the performance of unsupervised problems can be a difficult task. We needed to identify meaningful metrics to be able to compare the algorithms.  
The metrics we used are all intuitive and based on common sense when thinking about how a community should behave (internaly and externaly). All our results and analyses are clearly explain in the pdf file.
