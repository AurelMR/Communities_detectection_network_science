# Communities_detectection_network_science
Final project of the Machine Learning in Network Science class at CentraleSupelec

The goal of the project was to study and compare the different graph clustering methods.

We studied 5 different clustering algorithms:
* Girvan Newman
* Spectral Clustering
* Modularity Maximization
* Louvain / Surprise / Leiden Community Detection
